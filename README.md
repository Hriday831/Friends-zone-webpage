## 💡 Project Overview

**Friendship Zone** is a web application designed to help users deepen their connections by providing a central hub to organize, learn about, and easily make contact with their friends. Think of it as a personalized, insightful contact book that goes beyond just names and phone numbers.

Are you tired of forgetting a friend's name, their socials media handle, or the best way to reach them? Friendship Zone helps you track those meaningful details so you can be a better, more thoughtful friend.

## ✨ Features

The application utilizes a simple, two-page structure for optimal navigation:

  #### 🏠 Welcome Page (`index.html`)
  - A fully responsive entry point featuring an attractive, dynamic animation (via **LottieFiles**).  
  - Enhances user experience and guides navigation to the main page.
  
  #### 👥 Main Page (`classmate/friends`)
  The core section displaying a collection of **interactive cards**, each serving as a comprehensive peer profile, including:
  - Essential contact details and personalized notes.  
  - A consolidated set of **social media accounts** (GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook) for direct access and networking.



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Provides the foundational structure and semantics for the web content.  
- **CSS3:** Employed for clean, responsive styling, ensuring an attractive and functional layout across all device sizes.
